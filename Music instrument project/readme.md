##Homework 1 
###Research

Here are some exampeles of making music with arduino. In these projects there are all physical objects invovled. By touching the physical objects, players are able to make certain sound.

Sensors:
Force Resistance Sensor: FSRs are sensors that allow you to detect physical pressure, squeezing and weight. 

PIR Motion Sensor -Pyroelectric ("Passive") InfraRed Sensors: PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range. 

Thermocouple: thermocouples have no electronics inside them, they are simply made by welding together two metal wires. 

IR Sensor: IR detectors are little microchips with a photocell that are tuned to listen to infrared light. They are almost always used for remote control detection - every TV and DVD player has one of these in the front to listen for the IR signal from the clicker.

##Homework2
### Proposal 
### Here is my musical instrument project proposal
file:///Users/rujiatang/Desktop/visual%20interaction/musical%20instrument%20proposal.html

The name of this project is Octatonic 

This is an fun and simple version of piano. Using objects as keyboard.

Each project produce a note and there are 8 notes.
