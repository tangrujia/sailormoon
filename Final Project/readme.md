# Musical Instrument Continue. 

*For my mid-term projet, I had to up on the original idea about Object based piano becuase the capacitive sensor shield I ordered arrived so late. I want to use the shield in the final project. 

# Goal:
* Create an object based music intrument. 
* Uplevel the "piano" to "launchpad" by taking the code into processing and using minim. 
* Move away from the bread board. 
* Based on what object is being touched, the instrument play different type of music.
* Players can mix and match the music by touching different objects.
